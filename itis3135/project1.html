        <h2>Project 1</h2>
        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>For my client project, I will be building a web-based application that teaches the basics of python. This
            website is intended for people with little to no prior programming experience. The website will offer a
            structured curriculum covering the basic concepts of Python including syntax, variables, control structures,
            and functions. The website will have interactive exercises so that my client can apply Python in practical
            scenarios.</p>
